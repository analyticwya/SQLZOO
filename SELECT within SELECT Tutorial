#3 List the name and continent of countries in the continents containing either Argentina or Australia. Order by name of the country.

select name, continent from world
where continent in (select continent from world where name in ('Argentina','Australia')) order by name
(# use name in('a','b','c'...) to represent or relationship)

#4 Which country has a population that is more than Canada but less than Poland? Show the name and the population.
select name,population from world 
where population > (select population from world where name = 'Canada') 
and population < (select population from world where name = 'Poland')

#5 Germany (population 80 million) has the largest population of the countries in Europe. 
Austria (population 8.5 million) has 11% of the population of Germany.
Show the name and the population of each country in Europe. 
Show the population as a percentage of the population of Germany.

select name,CONCAT(round(population/(select population from world where name = 'Germany')*100)) 
from world where continent = 'Europe'
(# Decimal places
You can use the function ROUND to remove the decimal places.
Percent symbol %
You can use the function CONCAT to add the percentage symbol.)

#6 Which countries have a GDP greater than every country in Europe? [Give the name only.] (Some countries may have NULL gdp values)

SELECT name
  FROM world
 WHERE gdp> ALL(SELECT gdp FROM world WHERE gdp>0 and continent = 'Europe')
(# We can use the word ALL to allow >= or > or < or <=to act over a list. 
For example, you can find the largest country in the world, by population with this query:
SELECT name
  FROM world
 WHERE population >= ALL(SELECT population
                           FROM world
                          WHERE population>0) )
                          
#7 Find the largest country (by area) in each continent, show the continent, the name and the area:
SELECT x.name, x.continent
SELECT continent, name, area FROM world x
  WHERE area>= ALL
    (SELECT area FROM world y
        WHERE y.continent=x.continent
          AND area>0)
(# Important!!! self join & use of ALL operator)
